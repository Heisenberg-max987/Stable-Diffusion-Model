# Stable-Diffusion-Model
Modified from the original version
-The objective was to make the model capable of generating detailed images given any text prompt.
-The task involved building the three main blocks of the model, such as the variational autoencoder (VAE),
U-Net, and CLIP text encoder, creating the pipeline to combine all blocks, and finally creating the DDPM sampler
to remove the noise from the image predicted by U-Net.
